**Analysis Date:** November 22, 2025  
**Updated:** November 22, 2025  
**Purpose:** Determine which specific Philippine Scout regiment Sulpicio P. Maglanoc likely served in

---

## What We Know

### Confirmed Information
1. **Full Name**: Sulpicio P. Maglanoc (middle name unknown)
2. **Birth Date**: May 2, 1922
3. **Age at War Start**: 19 years old (December 8, 1941)
4. **Age at Bataan Surrender**: 19 years old (turned 20 on May 2, 1942, during captivity)
5. **Insignia**: Yellow/gold carabao (ox/water buffalo) head on red background

## Philippine Division Units on Bataan

### Infantry Regiments (Most Likely)

**1. 45th Infantry Regiment (Philippine Scouts)**

---

**3. 31st Infantry Regiment (United States)**
- **NOT a Philippine Scout unit** - All American
- Sulpicio would NOT have been in this unit (he was Filipino)
- Included for completeness only

---

### Cavalry Regiment (Possible)

**4. 26th Cavalry Regiment (Philippine Scouts)**
- **Strength**: Approximately 800 men (smaller than infantry regiments)
- **Commander**: Colonel Clinton A. Pierce (American)

- Many horses killed; soldiers fought on foot

**Probability for Sulpicio**: **LOW-MODERATE** (10-15%)
- Smaller unit = fewer personnel
- Elite unit requiring cavalry training and horsemanship
- At age 18-19, unlikely to have specialized cavalry training

- Young recruit unlikely to have this technical training
- Artillery typically took more experienced soldiers

**25th Field Artillery Regiment (Philippine Scouts)**
- Also served on Bataan
- Similar role to 24th Field Artillery
- Probability: **LOW-MODERATE** (5-10%)
