**RE: Request for Military Service Records - Sulpicio P. Maglanoc, Philippine Scouts, WWII**

Dear NARA Archivist,

I am writing to request the complete military service records for my grandfather, **Sulpicio P. Maglanoc** (alternative spellings: Sulpisio Maglanoc, Maglanok, or Maglañoc), who served as a Philippine Scout in the United States Army during World War II.

**KNOWN INFORMATION:**

My grandfather served with the Philippine Scouts, an elite unit of Filipino soldiers within the U.S. Army. Based on family accounts and the unit insignia he wore (the carabao/water buffalo emblem), I have confirmed he was part of the **Philippine Division**.

**Confirmed Service Details:**
- **Full Name:** Sulpicio P. Maglanoc (middle name unknown)
- **Date of Birth:** May 2, 1922 (CRITICAL SEARCH PARAMETER)
- **Age at Enlistment:** Approximately 18-19 years old (1940-1941)
- **Age at Bataan:** 19 years old (turned 20 on May 2, 1942 during captivity)
- **Branch:** United States Army - Philippine Scouts (PS)
- **Unit:** Philippine Division (most likely 45th or 57th Infantry Regiment based on age/role)
- **Likely Rank:** Private or Private First Class (young recruit)
- **Campaign:** Defense of Bataan, January-April 1942
- **Captured:** April 9, 1942, when Bataan fell (age 19)
- **POW Experience:** Bataan Death March survivor
- **POW Camps:** Likely Camp O'Donnell and/or Cabanatuan
- **Survival:** Survived the war and liberation (1945)
- **Post-War:** Returned to Philippines; died of lung cancer (date unknown)

**RECORDS REQUESTED:**

I am requesting all available records, including but not limited to:

1. **Complete Official Military Personnel File (OMPF)**
2. **Service Record** showing:
   - Exact unit assignment (regiment, company, platoon)
   - Rank and service number
   - Dates of enlistment and discharge
   - Duty assignments and stations
3. **Unit Rosters and Muster Rolls** for Philippine Division units (1941-1942)
4. **Discharge Papers** (DD-214 equivalent or Report of Separation)
5. **POW Records:**
   - Bataan Death March documentation
   - Camp O'Donnell records
   - Cabanatuan POW camp records
   - Liberation records (1945)
   - Red Cross POW records if available
6. **Award and Decoration Citations** (if applicable)
7. **Medical Records** (may contain POW camp documentation)
8. **Morning Reports** for his unit during 1941-1942
9. **Any photographs or service documents** on file

**SEARCH ASSISTANCE REQUESTED:**

As I do not have my grandfather's service number, I request that archivists search under:
- **Primary Search Parameter:** Birth date **May 2, 1922** (this is the most unique identifier)
- **Name variations:** Maglanoc, Sulpicio P. / Sulpicio P. Maglanoc / Sulpisio Maglanoc / Maglanok / Maglañoc
- **All Philippine Division Scout units** on Bataan, with priority on:
  - 45th Infantry Regiment (PS) - HIGHEST PROBABILITY
  - 57th Infantry Regiment (PS) - HIGHEST PROBABILITY
  - 26th Cavalry Regiment (PS)
  - 24th Field Artillery Regiment (PS)
- **POW rosters** from Camp O'Donnell and Cabanatuan (organized by birth date or alphabetically)
- **Bataan Death March survivor lists**
- **Enlistment records 1940-1941** for recruits aged 18-19

**PURPOSE OF REQUEST:**

I am conducting historical research to document the service and sacrifice of Philippine Scouts during World War II. This project aims to:
- Honor my grandfather's service and preserve his story for future generations
- Document Filipino contributions to the Pacific War for educational purposes
- Create a comprehensive historical account for family records

As the grandson/granddaughter and next of kin of this deceased veteran, I am entitled to receive these records under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and relevant privacy act provisions.

**ADDITIONAL CONTEXT:**

The Philippine Scouts were elite U.S. Army units composed of Filipino soldiers who fought with extraordinary courage during the defense of Bataan. My grandfather rarely spoke of his experiences, but he did share stories about the horrors of the POW camps. Before he passed, I promised myself I would research and document his service to ensure his sacrifice—and that of thousands of Filipino soldiers—is remembered.

Any records you can locate would be deeply meaningful to my family and would contribute to preserving this important chapter of WWII history.

**CONTACT INFORMATION:**

Please contact me at the address, email, or phone number listed above if you need any additional information to assist in locating these records. I am happy to provide any additional details that might help.

I understand that record retrieval may take several weeks to months, and I appreciate your assistance in this matter.

Thank you for your time and dedication to preserving our nation's military history.

Respectfully,

**[Your Signature]**  
**[Your Printed Name]**
