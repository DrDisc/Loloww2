## 1. SPANISH COLONIAL PERIOD (1565-1898)

### 1.1 Initial Colonization

**Ferdinand Magellan's Arrival (1521)**
- Portuguese navigator Magellan headed the first Spanish expedition to the Philippines, making landfall on Cebu in March 1521[^1]
- Magellan died shortly after on nearby Mactan island
- After three failed expeditions, King Philip II (for whom the islands are named) sent Miguel López de Legazpi, who established the first permanent Spanish settlement in Cebu in 1565[^1]

**Establishment of Spanish Rule**
- Spanish city of Manila was founded in 1571[^1]
- By the end of the 16th century, most coastal and lowland areas from Luzon to northern Mindanao were under Spanish control[^1]
- Friars accompanied soldiers and accomplished nominal conversion to Roman Catholicism of all local people under Spanish administration[^1]
- Muslims of Mindanao and Sulu (called "Moros" by the Spanish) were never completely subdued[^1]

### 1.2 Spanish Colonial Administration

**The Encomienda System**
- Spanish rule for the first 100 years was exercised through tax farming imported from the Americas, known as the *encomienda*[^1]
- Abusive treatment of tribute payers, neglect of religious instruction, and frequent withholding of revenues from the crown caused Spain to abandon the system by the end of the 17th century[^1]

**Centralized Government**
- Central government in Manila retained a medieval cast until the 19th century[^1]
- The governor-general was so powerful he was often likened to an independent monarch
- He dominated the Audiencia (high court), was captain-general of armed forces, and enjoyed privilege of engaging in commerce for private profit[^1]

**Manila's Dominance**
- The galleon trade with Acapulco, Mexico assured Manila's commercial primacy[^1]
- Exchange of Chinese silks for Mexican silver attracted large Chinese community despite periodic massacres[^1]
- Chinese eventually established dominance of commerce that survived through centuries[^1]

### 1.3 Role of the Catholic Church

**Ecclesiastical Power Structure**
- Manila was the ecclesiastical capital of the Philippines[^1]
- The archbishop vied with the governor-general for political supremacy, frequently winning in the late 17th and 18th centuries[^1]
- Religious orders acquired great wealth, mostly in land through royal grants and arbitrary extensions[^1]

**Cultural Impact**
- Priests and friars had command of local languages rare among lay Spanish[^1]
- They outnumbered civil officials in the provinces, serving as invaluable source of information to colonial government[^1]
- Cultural goal was full Christianization and Hispanization of Filipinos[^1]
- Despite suppression, pre-Spanish Filipino culture and beliefs persisted under Roman Catholic garb[^1]

**Economic and Social Changes**
- Priests attempted to move all people into *pueblos* (villages) surrounding stone churches[^1]
- Dispersed demographic patterns of old *barangays* largely persisted[^1]
- The *datu*'s once hereditary position became subject to Spanish appointment[^1]
- Agricultural technology changed slowly until late 18th century, with shifting cultivation giving way to intensive sedentary farming[^1]
- Introduction of Western concept of absolute land ownership allowed *datus* and old noble class (*principalia*) to claim fields as their own[^1]

### 1.4 Military Structure Under Spain

**Spanish Colonial Military Forces**
- *Guardia Civil* served as the colonial military-police force during Spanish rule[^2]
- Spanish forces were supplemented by Filipino mercenaries[^3]
- Military administration was centered in Manila with garrisons throughout major settlements

- Armed rebellion broke out in 1896[^4]

**Cavite Mutiny (1872)**
- Brief uprising against Spanish served as excuse for renewed repression[^5]

**Propaganda Movement**
- Reform-minded Filipinos took refuge in Europe, carrying on literary campaign[^5]
- Dr. José Rizal emerged as leading Propagandist[^5]
- His novel *Noli me tángere* (1886) exposed corruption of Manila Spanish society and stimulated independence movement[^5]

### 2.2 The Revolution Begins

**Formation of the Katipunan (1892)**
- Andres Bonifacio organized secret revolutionary society in Manila[^5]
- Membership grew to estimated 100,000 by August 1896[^5]
- When Spaniards discovered its existence, Bonifacio immediately issued call for armed rebellion[^5]

**Execution of José Rizal (December 30, 1896)**
- Spain arrested Rizal, who had advocated reform but never condoned revolution[^5]
- His public execution so enraged and united Filipinos as to make permanent Spanish retention of power clearly impossible[^5]

**Leadership Transition**
- In March 1897, leadership passed to young general Emilio Aguinaldo[^5]
- Aguinaldo had Bonifacio shot for alleged sedition[^5]
- Aguinaldo proved incapable of militarily defeating Spanish troops augmented by Filipino mercenaries[^5]

- Brought temporary end to Philippine Revolution[^5]
- Aguinaldo and other revolutionary leaders accepted exile in Hong Kong[^5]
- Spain promised 400,000 pesos plus substantial governmental reforms[^5]

- Introduced social reforms[^4]

## 5. AMERICAN COLONIAL PERIOD (1898-1935)

### 5.1 U.S. Colonial Administration

**Justification for Colonial Rule**
- Juxtaposition of U.S. democracy and imperial rule over subject people was sufficiently jarring that training Filipinos for self-government and ultimate independence was essential rationalization for U.S. hegemony[^8]
- Malolos Republic was conveniently ignored[^8]

**First Philippine Commission (1899)**
- President McKinley sent five-person fact-finding commission headed by Cornell University president Jacob G. Schurman[^8]
- Schurman reported Filipinos wanted ultimate independence, but this had no immediate impact on policy[^8]
