# Filipino Guerrilla Resistance (1942-1944)

**Summary of underground and guerrilla activity during Japanese occupation**

After the surrender of Bataan (April 9, 1942) and Corregidor (May 6, 1942), organized American-Filipino military resistance officially ended. However, this marked the **beginning** of a widespread guerrilla warfare campaign that would continue until liberation in 1944-1945.

## **1943: Consolidation and "Lie Low"**

### **MacArthur's Order**

After Moses' failure, MacArthur orders guerrillas to **"lie low" in 1943**
- Focus on intelligence gathering
- Minimize combat
- Build organization
- Preserve forces for liberation

**Not fully obeyed**:

---

## **Role of Released Filipino POWs**

### **Japanese Dilemma**

What to do with thousands of surviving Filipino POW?
- Treat as POW = no sympathy
- Release = trained guerrilla nucleus

**Initially hostile**: Terrible atrocities in camps

**Policy reversal**: Military Administration argues for pragmatic charity
- Rehabilitation/indoctrination program
- Then release

**Result**: Having alienated them, Japanese turn them loose
- **Most join guerrilla movements within short period**

### **Examples**

**Captain Alejo Santos**:
- Captured at Bataan, Death March
- Escapes at Betis, Pampanga
- July 1942: Forms "Philippine Legion" at Bulacan
- December 1943: Consolidates all Bulacan groups

**Lt. Col. Ruperto Kangleon**:
- Escapes POW camp Agusan
- April 20, 1943: Takes command Leyte guerrillas

### **Senior Officer Collaboration**

**Brigadier-General Vicente Lim**:
- Refuses to head puppet Constabulary
- Confines himself at Philippine General Hospital (pronounced "sick")
- Personally finances guerrilla activities
- Directs operations from hospital
- Operatives give weekly reports on Japanese movements
- **Intelligence greatly contributes to 1944-1945 liberation**
- **August 1944**: Captured by Kenpeitai trying to escape
- Tortured in Fort Santiago
- **Allegedly beheaded**, buried in unknown grave

---

## **Intelligence Operations**

Guerrillas provided **crucial intelligence** to MacArthur in Australia:

**Information gathered**:
- Japanese troop movements
- Unit dispositions
- Military installations
- Ship movements
- Airfield activities
- Supply routes
- Garrison strengths

**Methods**:
- Local informants
- Reconnaissance patrols
- Coast watchers
- Radio networks
- Submarine couriers

**Impact**: Made 1944 liberation possible
- MacArthur knew exactly where Japanese forces were
- Could plan landing sites
- Coordinate with guerrillas for attacks

---

## **Japanese Response**

### **Brutal Suppression**

- **Kempeitai** (military police) hunted guerrillas
- Torture of suspects
- Execution of captured guerrillas
- Reprisals against villages helping guerrillas
- Mass killings to intimidate population

### **Puppet Forces**

- **Bureau of Constabulary** (Filipino collaborators)
- **Makapili** (pro-Japanese militia)
- Used to hunt guerrillas and informants

### **Failed to Break Resistance**

Despite brutality:
- Guerrillas kept growing
- Population supported them
- Japanese control limited to major towns
- Countryside often "free Filipino territory"

---

## **Success and Impact**

### **Military Impact**

**Tied up Japanese forces**:
- Troops that could have been used in frontlines
- Kept in Philippines for garrison duty
- Constant threat required dispersed forces

**Wrested control**:
- Many provinces effectively free
- Panay almost entirely liberated
- Some islands had functioning civil governments

**Prepared for liberation**:
- Organizations in place
- Communication networks established
- Ready to support MacArthur's return

### **Intelligence Value**

**"Mission as intelligence units can be of utmost value"** - MacArthur

Guerrillas provided:
- Detailed maps of Japanese positions
- Daily reports of movements
- Early warning of operations
- Beach landing reconnaissance
- Post-landing support

### **Strategic Significance**

**Prevented Japanese consolidation**:
- Could never fully control Philippines
- Constant instability
- Resources diverted from other fronts

**Symbol of resistance**:
- Showed Filipinos never accepted occupation
- Boosted morale
- Vindicated MacArthur's "I Shall Return" promise

---

## **Connection to 1944 Liberation**

When MacArthur returned October 1944:
- **~260,000 Filipino guerrillas ready**
- Provided guides for US forces
- Attacked Japanese rear areas
- Secured liberated areas
- Provided intelligence
- Prevented Japanese scorched-earth

**Many guerrilla leaders became national heroes**:
- **Ramon Magsaysay**: President 1953-1957
- **Ruperto Kangleon**: Philippine Army Chief of Staff
- **Russell Volckmann**: Founded US Army Special Forces

---

## **Legacy**

### **Immediate Post-War**

**Some groups disbanded**
**Some became problems**:
- **Huks** continued fighting as communist insurgency
- Required **Ramon Magsaysay's campaign** to defeat (1950-1954)

### **Historical Significance**

**Largest guerrilla movement in WWII**:
- More fighters than French Resistance
- Covered entire archipelago
- Sustained 3+ years
- Successful intelligence operations

**Model for future operations**:
- US Army Special Forces studied Philippine guerrillas
- Counter-insurgency lessons
- Unconventional warfare tactics

### **Filipino National Identity**

**Resistance proved**:
- Filipinos fought for independence
- Not passive under occupation
- Capable of self-governance
- Deserved independence (granted 1946)

## **For Your Project**

### **Why This Matters**

Your lolo (Sulpicio Maglanoc) was **POW from April 1942 to liberation**

**But guerrillas**:
- Were often his fellow soldiers who escaped
- Provided hope that resistance continued
- Made his eventual liberation possible
- Kept fighting while he suffered in camps

### **Context for Article/Video**

**After covering surrender and Death March**, explain:
- "But this was not the end of Filipino resistance..."
- Show how guerrillas kept fighting
- Connect to MacArthur's return 1944
- Show lolo's liberation was result of guerrilla intelligence

### **Emotional Arc**

1. **Defeat** (April 9, 1942 - surrender)
2. **Horror** (Death March, POW camps)
3. **Hope** (guerrillas still fighting)
4. **Vindication** (MacArthur returns 1944)
5. **Liberation** (POWs freed)

---

**The guerrillas ensured that while Sulpicio Maglanoc suffered in POW camps, the fight for Philippine freedom never stopped.**
