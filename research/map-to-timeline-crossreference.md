## **1. Disposition of U.S. Army Forces, Far East (December 8, 1941)**

### **Timeline Reference**: Pre-War Situation (July-December 1941)

### **What This Map Shows**:
- **PRE-WAR deployment** - where everyone was BEFORE the Japanese invasion
- **North Luzon Force** (Gen Wainwright): 4 Infantry Divisions, 1 Cavalry Regiment
- **South Luzon Force** (Gen Parker): 2 Infantry Divisions
- **Reserve Force**: 2 Infantry Divisions (around Manila)
- **Visayan-Mindanao Force** (Gen Sharp): 3 Infantry Divisions
- Force sector boundaries marked with "XXX"

### **Key Timeline Events**:

**July 26, 1941**: USAFFE formed under MacArthur
- 150,000 personnel total
- 31st Infantry (fully American)
- 3 Philippine Scouts regiments (45th, 57th, 26th Cavalry)
- 10 Philippine Army divisions (inexperienced)
- Far East Air Force: 218 modern aircraft

**MacArthur's Fatal Decision**:
- Rejects WPO-3 (withdrawal to Bataan plan)
- Pursues own "beach defense" strategy
- **Disperses forces widely across 9 major islands**
- Breaches WPO-3 by scattering vital war equipment
- Believes Japanese won't attack until April 1942

### **Where Was Sulpicio Maglanoc?**
- Likely with **Reserve Force** or **South Luzon Force**
- As Philippine Scout (45th or 57th Infantry), positioned around Manila area
- Would retreat to Bataan starting December 24-26

### **Tactical Significance**:
This shows MacArthur's **flawed deployment**:
- Forces too spread out to support each other
- Equipment scattered (can't move to Bataan quickly)
- When invasion came early, impossible to execute WPO-3 properly

---

## **2. Advance Japanese Landings Philippines (December 8-20, 1941)**

### **Timeline Reference**: December 8-20, 1941

### **What This Map Shows**:
- **First wave of Japanese landings** (not main invasion yet)
- Landing sites with dates:
  - Batan Island (Dec 8)
  - Aparri (Dec 10)
  - Vigan (Dec 10)
  - Legazpi (Dec 12)
  - Davao (Dec 20)

### **Key Timeline Events**:

**December 8, 1941**: 
- 490 SNLF marines land on **Batan Island**, capture airfield
- Extends Japanese aircraft range over Philippines

**December 10, 1941**:
- **Aparri**: Land unopposed, capture airfield in hours
- **Vigan**: Face B-17/P-40 attacks, forced to retreat
  - Return next day, land 4 miles south
  - Capture Laoag and Vigan airfield

**December 12, 1941**:
- **Legazpi**: Land unopposed, capture city and airfield
- Japanese also take Tuguegarao airfield

**December 20, 1941**:
- **Davao**: Sakaguchi and Miura Detachments land at night
- 101st Division (Philippine Army) surprised but resists
- Japanese take city by midday after heavy fighting

### **Tactical Significance**:
These are **airfield seizure operations**:
- Extend Japanese air coverage
- Prepare for main invasion at Lingayen Gulf and Lamon Bay
- Small forces (~2,000 men each)
- MacArthur furious at Wainwright for not resisting (unfair - forces too weak)

### **MacArthur's Mistake**:
Should have implemented WPO-3 withdrawal to Bataan **immediately on December 8**
- Instead waits until December 24
- Loses precious time to move supplies to Bataan

---

## **3. Japanese Invasion Lingayen Gulf (December 1941)**

### **Timeline Reference**: December 21-22, 1941

### **What This Map Shows**:
- **Main invasion landing zones** in Lingayen Gulf
- Three landing points (likely Agoo area, Bauang, Damortis region)
- Routes inland toward Baguio and Manila
- North Luzon Force positions

### **Key Timeline Events**:

**December 21, 1941 - NIGHT**:
Three Japanese invasion forces arrive at Lingayen Gulf:
- 1st Force: 9th Regiment from Keelung
- 2nd Force: From Penghu Islands
- 3rd Force: From Takao

US submarines discover convoys, destroy only 1 transport

**December 22, 1941 - EARLY MORNING - MAIN INVASION BEGINS**:
- Homma's forces land at three positions
- Land **largely unopposed** at beaches
- Overrun 11th Division units south of Agoo

**Same day**:
- 9th Regiment lands at Bauang
- Attacks north toward San Fernando
- Attacks east toward Baguio
- Japanese reunite around San Fernando

**MacArthur's "Active Defense" Fails Completely**:
- Cannot stop Japanese on beaches as planned
- 26th Cavalry Regiment line at Damortis quickly broken
- M3 tank platoon destroyed at Rosario
- **By nightfall**: Homma secures Rosario and immediate area

### **Where Was Sulpicio Maglanoc?**
- Not at Lingayen Gulf (likely still around Manila area with Reserve Force)
- His retreat to Bataan would begin December 24

### **Tactical Significance**:
This is **MacArthur's beach defense plan completely failing**:
- Inexperienced Philippine divisions can't hold
- Japanese armor and firepower overwhelm defenders
- Forces MacArthur to establish delaying line behind Agno River

---

## **4. Lingayen Gulf Landings and Japanese Advance (22-24 December 1941)**

### **Timeline Reference**: December 22-24, 1941

### **What This Map Shows**:
- **Detailed view of 3-day period** after Lingayen landings
- Japanese advance inland from beachheads
- Routes toward San Fernando, Baguio, and south toward Manila
- North Luzon Force defensive positions and retreat routes

### **Key Timeline Events**:

**December 22, 1941**:
- Japanese land at three positions in Lingayen Gulf (early morning)
- Overrun 11th Division south of Agoo
- 9th Regiment (Bauang) attacks both directions
- Japanese reunite around San Fernando by end of day

**December 23, 1941**:
- Japanese push from Sison and Pozorrubio
- 26th Cavalry surrounded at Binalonan - escape after 4 hours fighting
- **MacArthur establishes first defensive line behind Agno River**
- **Begins moving Manila forces to Bataan Peninsula**

**December 24, 1941**:
- **CRITICAL DECISION**: MacArthur **finally implements WPO-3**
- Orders general retreat to Bataan Peninsula
- **TOO LATE** - should have been done weeks earlier
- Most troops can retreat but **without most supplies** (had to be abandoned)

### **Tactical Significance**:
Shows the **rapid Japanese advance** forcing MacArthur's hand:
- Japanese cover 10+ miles inland in 48 hours
- Filipino divisions unable to mount effective resistance
- Forces scattered across Philippines **cannot help** (MacArthur's deployment error)

---

## **5. Lamon Bay Landings Philippines (24 December 1941)**

### **Timeline Reference**: December 24, 1941

### **What This Map Shows**:
- **Second major invasion** - 16th Division landing sites at Lamon Bay
- Three landing points on bay's shores
- Routes inland toward Manila from the south/southeast
- South Luzon Force positions (disorganized)

### **Key Timeline Events**:

**December 24, 1941 - DAWN - LAMON BAY LANDINGS**:
- **7,000 men of 16th Division** hit beaches at three points
- Face General Parker's South Luzon Force
- **1st and 51st Divisions disorganized**:
  - 51st Division was moving to Legaspi
  - Caught without artillery
  - Not in proper defensive positions

**MacArthur's command confusion**:
- Places Parker under Bataan command
- Assigns South Luzon Force to Brig. Gen. Albert Jones

**Tactical situation**:
- Morioka faces fierce resistance at Mauban (dug-in Filipinos)
- Forces from Legaspi meet at Siain
- 16th Division presses toward Mount Banahao and Tayabas Bay (route to Manila)

**Same day**: 
- MacArthur declares Manila an "open city"
- Japanese bomb it anyway

### **Tactical Significance**:
This is **Japanese pincer movement** coming together:
- North force (Lingayen Gulf) pushing south
- South force (Lamon Bay) pushing north
- Plan: Trap defenders around Manila
- MacArthur's only option: **retreat to Bataan**

### **Where Was Sulpicio Maglanoc?**
- Likely beginning retreat from Manila area to Bataan
- If with Reserve Force, would move through Calumpit bridges
- **Critical race**: Both North and South Luzon Forces must coordinate retreat or get trapped

---

## **6. 960px Japanese Operations on Luzon (Dec 1941)**

### **Timeline Reference**: December 8-31, 1941

### **What This Map Shows**:
- **COMPLETE OVERVIEW** of entire December invasion
- All landing sites with dates (Dec 8, 10, 12, 22-23, 24, 27, 30, 31)
- Red arrows show main Japanese drives from north and south
- Yellow shaded area = Japanese-controlled territory by end of December
- Shows how US-Filipino forces compressed into Bataan Peninsula (southwest)

### **Key Timeline Events - Complete December Campaign**:

**December 8**: Pearl Harbor + Clark Field disaster
**December 10**: Aparri, Vigan landings (airfield seizures)
**December 12**: Legazpi landing (south Luzon)
**December 22-23**: **Main invasion Lingayen Gulf** (north)
**December 24**: **Lamon Bay landings** (south) + WPO-3 implemented
**December 27**: Japanese reach San Manuel, San Quintin (north)
**December 28**: **THE RACE TO BATAAN** begins
**December 30**: Japanese break through San Miguel (Wainwright's third line)
**December 31**: 7th Tank Regiment breaks through, reaches Baliuag

**Key locations marked**:
- Manila (center)
- Bataan Peninsula (west, where forces retreat)
- Corregidor Island (south of Bataan)
- All invasion routes converging on Manila

### **Tactical Significance - The Whole Picture**:
This map shows **MacArthur's strategic defeat**:
1. Japanese land at multiple points (Dec 8-24)
2. Advance rapidly from north and south (pincer)
3. Force MacArthur to abandon "active defense" plan
4. Compress all defenders into Bataan Peninsula
5. Manila falls January 2, 1942

**The retreat** shown on this map is where Sulpicio Maglanoc would have participated:
- Part of massive movement of 80,000+ troops
- Moving from scattered positions to Bataan
- Under Japanese pressure from multiple directions
- Race against time to cross bridges before Japanese cut them off

---

## **7. Situation on Bataan (8 January 1942)**

### **Timeline Reference**: January 6-8, 1942

### **What This Map Shows**:
- **FIRST defensive positions after retreat into Bataan**
- Main Battle Position and Rear Battle Position
- Unit designations visible (41st, 51st, 57th, etc.)
- I Corps and II Corps boundaries
- Mount Natib in center (showing the gap)
- Mauban Line in north (initial defensive attempt)
- Topographic features with elevations

### **Key Timeline Events**:

**January 6, 1942 - DAWN - WITHDRAWAL COMPLETE**:
- Most forces retreat behind Culo River
- **Layac bridge blown up** (minor delay for Japanese)
- **Defenders placed on half-rations** - starvation begins
- Japanese attack Layac line - defenders forced back

**Nightfall**: Wainwright orders abandonment of Layac
- Retreat to **Abucay and Mauban lines**
- **End of withdrawal into Bataan**

**Defensive Organization**:

**I Corps (West)** - General Wainwright
- 4 divisions + 1 Philippine Scouts regiment
- Defends Mauban (coast) to Mount Silanganan ranges

**II Corps (East)** - General Parker
- 4 divisions + 1 Philippine Scouts regiment
- **45th Infantry Regiment (Philippine Scouts)** - YOUR LOLO'S LIKELY UNIT
- **57th Infantry Regiment (Philippine Scouts)** - Adjacent to 45th
- Defends Mount Natib foothills to Mabatang on Manila Bay

**CRITICAL WEAKNESS visible on map**:
- **Mount Natib gap in center** (thought impassable)
- Two corps not in direct contact
- Japanese will exploit this gap

**Rear defensive position**: Bagac to Orion line (last line of defense)

### **Where Was Sulpicio Maglanoc?**
- **NOW ON BATAAN** with his Philippine Scouts unit
- Likely with **II Corps** (eastern sector)
- Positioned on or near the **Abucay Line**
- With **57th Regiment (Philippine Scouts)** defending against Japanese attacks

### **Tactical Significance**:
This shows **MacArthur's defense-in-depth strategy**:
- Use rugged terrain (jungles, mountains) for defense
- Entrenched positions
- Two corps defending parallel lines
- But Mount Natib gap is fatal flaw

**Casualties so far**: Americans lost 13,000 men; Japanese only 2,000

**Supply situation**: Half-rations already (should be supplied for 6 months under WPO-3, only have ~30 days)

---

## **8. The Mauban Line (18-25 January 1942)**

### **Timeline Reference**: January 18-25, 1942

### **What This Map Shows**:
- **Western sector (I Corps) defensive positions**
- Black arrows = Axis of Japanese attack
- White arrows = Axis of U.S. counterattack
- Japanese roadblock labeled (cutting supply lines)
- Counterattacks by 26th Cavalry PS, 31st and 45th Infantry
- Dates showing progressive action (Jan 19-24)
- Terrain contours incomplete due to inadequate mapping

### **Key Timeline Events**:

**January 18, 1942**:
- Japanese reinforced with main force of 16th Division
- **Major-General Kimura Naoki takes command** western offensive
- Japanese push 1st Division out of Mauban Line
- **16th Division breaks through "impassable" Mount Natib**
- Drives southwest of Silanganan ridge
- Objective: Cut off Filipino defenders

**January 18-25**: Desperate counterattacks
- 26th Cavalry Regiment attacks
- 31st and 45th Infantry attack to dislodge Japanese breakthrough
- **Failed to restore Mauban Line**
- Forced withdrawal to Orion-Bagac Line (main defensive position)
- Heavy casualties for Philippine Scouts units

**January 21, 1942**:
- **Mauban Line completely pierced**
- Japanese envelop 1st Division, push toward coast
- **Wainwright orders abandonment** - retreat south

### **Tactical Significance**:
Shows **failure of "impassable" terrain assumption**:
- Japanese DID cross Mount Natib
- Exploited gap between I and II Corps
- Forced Americans to fall back to final defensive position

**Note on map**: "Contoured outline of terrain configuration is incomplete, because of inadequate map coverage"
- Shows Americans fighting with inadequate maps
- Didn't fully understand terrain
- Japanese better prepared

## **9. Orion-Bagac Line / Battle of the Pockets (January-February 1942)**

### **Timeline Reference**: January 26 - February 20, 1942

### **What This Map Shows**:
- **Main defensive line across Bataan** (coast to coast)
- Blue hatched line = U.S. positions (surfaced, all-weather road)
- Partially surfaced roads and trails
- Unit positions: 45th, 57th PS, reserve units clearly marked
- Mariveles Mountains (center) providing defensive terrain
- Elevation contours in feet
- **THIS IS THE LINE THAT HELD FOR ALMOST 2 MONTHS**

### **Key Timeline Events**:

**January 26, 1942**: Withdrawal to Orion-Bagac Line complete
- Line divided into multiple sectors
- Japanese in hot pursuit: Nara (east), Kimura (west)

**January 9 - February 13**: **Battle of the Points**
- Japanese naval landings to bypass defenses
- Longoskawayan Point (defeated Jan 29)
- Quinauan Point (defeated Feb 8)
- Anyasan Point (defeated Feb 13)
- **Two entire Japanese battalions destroyed**

**February 6-20**: **Battle of the Pockets**
- Japanese break through I Corps jungle positions
- Force split into two pockets behind enemy lines:
  - **Big Pocket** (blocks traffic, hinders movement)
  - **Little Pocket** (annihilated Feb 9)
- Big Pocket evacuates Feb 11-15 (~400 escape through jungle)

**February 20, 1942**: **ORION-BAGAC LINE VICTORY**
- **Invaders complete withdrawal**
- Homma requests reinforcements (only Japanese commander defeated so far)
- 4th Division approved from Shanghai

### **Where Was Sulpicio Maglanoc?**
**THIS IS WHERE YOUR LOLO FOUGHT FOR 2+ MONTHS**:
- With **II Corps** (eastern sector)
- Likely **57th Regiment (Philippine Scouts)** - marked on map
- Held positions through:
  - Constant Japanese attacks
  - Battle of the Points threats to rear
  - Starvation (half-rations, then quarter-rations)
  - Disease (malaria, dysentery, beriberi)
  - No reinforcements
  - No resupply

**Life on the line** (Jan 27 - April 3):
- Constant artillery exchanges
- Patrol clashes and small-unit actions
- Starvation rations (1/4 normal by March)
- Disease epidemic
- "Battling Bastards of Bataan" - "No mama, no papa, no Uncle Sam"

### **Tactical Significance - THE MOST IMPORTANT MAP**:
This is where the **Philippine Scouts held the line**:
- **Strongest defensive position** on Bataan
- Well-prepared: foxholes, trenches, artillery positions
- I Corps (west): 1st, 91st PA divisions + 26th Cavalry
- II Corps (east): **41st, 51st, 57th Infantry (Philippine Scouts)**, 21st, 31st Infantry
- Mt. Limay and Mariveles Mts anchoring terrain

**This line held until April 3** - tremendous victory that:
- Tied up Japanese forces for 3 months
- Prevented invasion of Australia (troops stuck here)
- Became symbol of American-Filipino resistance
- Boosted morale despite eventual defeat

---

## **10. U.S. Army Lines Mount Samat (Japanese Penetration 3-6 April 1942)**

### **Timeline Reference**: April 3-6, 1942

### **What This Map Shows**:
- **MT. SAMAT** - the key terrain feature
- Japanese "4th Division" unit (fresh troops from reserves)
- Main line of resistance (April 3)
- Axis of Japanese attack (black arrows)
- Movement of U.S. reserve units trying to plug gaps (white arrows)
- **57 PS clearly marked** fighting on eastern sector
- Shows penetration before total collapse
- Red diagonal hatching = Japanese-held territory

### **Key Timeline Events**:

**April 3, 1942 - DAWN - THE BOMBARDMENT**:
- **6-hour air and artillery barrage** on Mount Samat area
- **Most devastating bombardment of the war**
- **Over 60 tons of bombs** dropped
- Destroys defenses, weakens three entire regiments

**Afternoon - Advance begins**:
- Nara confronts 41st Division
- Kitano faces 21st Division (Brig. Gen. Capinpin)
- **Expects heavy opposition but finds none** (bombardment devastated morale)
- Both forces advance up to 1,000 yards

**April 4, 1942**:
- Renewed bombardment
- 42nd and 43rd Regiments **flee south in stampede**
- Only 3 regiments left to stem offensive
- Japanese possess entire main line of resistance
- Right Wing reaches northern foothills of Samat

**King's response**: Sends 31st Regiment + places **45th and 57th Regiments on readiness**

**April 5, 1942 - EASTER SUNDAY - MOUNT SAMAT FALLS**:
- Right Wing advances unopposed to northwest slopes
- Forces American artillery to retreat
- Left Wing pushes defenders back
- **Right Wing reaches southern slopes, captures General Capinpin**
- **By nightfall: Mount Samat under Japanese control**

**April 6, 1942 - DISASTER**:
- King launches **four-pronged counterattack**
- **45th Regiment** (YOUR LOLO'S LIKELY UNIT): Most successful, overcomes resistance, advances north
- **57th Regiment**: Engaged by 65th Brigade elements
- **But counterattack clearly a failure**
- Kitano sends 37th Regiment + tanks against 51st Division
- Overruns positions, forces retreat

**By day's end**:
- **Loss of two divisions**
- **Complete breakdown of main line**

### **Where Was Sulpicio Maglanoc?**
**LIKELY IN THE APRIL 6 COUNTERATTACK**:
- **45th Regiment counterattack** = his probable unit
- Most successful of four prongs
- Overcame Japanese resistance
- Advanced north toward 41st Regiment
- **But had to withdraw to avoid encirclement**

OR if with **57th Regiment**:
- Engaged by forward elements of 65th Brigade
- Forced to retreat eastward on April 7

### **Tactical Significance**:
This map shows **the beginning of the end**:
- Mount Samat = key observation/artillery position
- Once lost, Japanese control heights
- Can observe all American movements
- Can bring accurate artillery fire on retreating troops
- **This bombardment broke the defenders' ability to resist**

**Note**: Map shows "Japanese Penetration 3-6 April 1942" - the 3 days that doomed Bataan

- Blue hatched = U.S. positions night of April 6-7
- Japanese attack arrows labeled with unit (16th Division, etc.)
- U.S. counterattack movements (dotted lines)
- **45th PS and 57th PS positions clearly marked** on east side
- Shows exactly how line broke
- Progressive collapse April 7 → 8 → 9

### **Key Timeline Events**:

**April 7, 1942 - MUCH WORSE**:

**Failed counterattack** to reestablish connection with I Corps (45th and 57th Regiments fought here yesterday)

**Homma capitalizes**:
- **Kitano spots gap** between southern San Vicente line and 57th Regiment
- **Sends 61st Regiment**
- **Highly successful - forces 57th Regiment to retreat eastward**

**Isolated 33rd Regiment**:
- Despite fierce resistance, **finally routed**
- Only few escape through jungles

**Main assault by 4th Division + Nagano Detachment**:
- Strike San Vicente River defenders
- Under relentless bombardment
- **Filipinos on right break - unorganized retreat**
- Americans on left fare slightly better but also forced back

**King sends 26th Cavalry** to cover withdrawal to Mamala River:
- Tenaciously resist
- **8th Regiment encircles them**
- **Forced to retreat**

**Afternoon**:
- New line on Mamala River
- **Invaders immediately hammer it**
- **Americans retreat to Alangan River**

**Wainwright's desperation**: Orders 11th Division attack eastward
- **Task impossible, already too late**

**Jones forced to withdraw** to Binuangan River

**Situation completely chaotic**

**April 8, 1942 - FINAL DAY**:
- Homma continues drive against Mariveles and Cabcaben
- Decimated forces continually retreat
- **II Corps fully disintegrated**
- **End is nigh**

**MacArthur orders attack on Olongapo**:
- **King dismisses it** - impossible
- **Orders demolition of equipment**

**King's decision**: Surrender only option (holds responsibility for 78,000 men)

**Homma sends tank vanguard** rushing to Mariveles

**April 9, 1942 - NOON - SURRENDER**:
- Japanese tanks reach HQ
- **Received with white flags**
- **King surrenders**
- **BATAAN HAS FALLEN**

### **Where Was Sulpicio Maglanoc?**
**IN THE FINAL COLLAPSE**:
- **April 7**: With 57th Regiment forced to retreat eastward
  - OR with 45th Regiment withdrawing to avoid encirclement
- **April 8**: Continually retreating under bombardment
  - Likely compressed toward Mariveles with other units
- **April 9**: **SURRENDERS** with ~78,000 others
  - **BATAAN DEATH MARCH BEGINS**

### **Tactical Significance - The Most Important Map for Your Lolo**:
This map shows **exactly where and how your lolo's unit collapsed**:
- **57th PS marked on eastern sector** being hit by Japanese penetration
- Red hatching shows Japanese advance engulfing positions
- Shows the **progressive dates** of collapse (April 7 → 8 → 9)
- Your lolo would have been in this red zone, retreating, then surrounded

**This is the last map before surrender and Death March**

### **Key Timeline Events**:

**December 24, 1941**: MacArthur moves HQ to Corregidor

**December 28, 1941 - January 6, 1942**:
- Regularly bombarded by Japanese air forces
- Heavy damage, morale drop
- Armament kept unscathed (luckily)

**February 1942**: Japanese artillery from Cavite intermittently shells

**March 15, 1942**: Heavier bombardment from Pico de Loro (damages Forts Frank and Drum)

**April 9, 1942 - FALL OF BATAAN**:
- Homma places heavy artillery on **slopes of Mariveles Mountains** (visible from Corregidor)
- Can now inflict real damage

**April 10 - May 5, 1942 - THE SIEGE (27 days)**:
- Artillery: 18 batteries, ~116 field pieces
- **Unleashes hell** with great effectiveness
- Destroys most beach defenses
- Destroys anti-aircraft guns
- Land cratered
- **Impossible to repair** (shelling never stops)
- Aerial bombardments increase damage
- Large sections shrouded in smoke and dust
- **Only safe place: Malinta Tunnels** (but can't fight from there)

**May 5, 1942 - NIGHT - ASSAULT BEGINS**:
- 61st Regiment lands further east than expected
- Pushes west toward **Malinta Hill**
- Pushes south against Monkey Point

**May 6, 1942 - EARLY HOURS**:
- Japanese take **Battery Denver** position
- Defeat marines
- **Threaten Malinta Tunnels**

**10:00 - SURRENDER**:
- Wainwright surrenders to prevent slaughter of 11,000 men in tunnels
- Surrenders four fortified islands in Manila Bay
- Japanese seize Malinta Tunnels

### **Tactical Significance**:
Shows **"Gibraltar of the East"** fortress:
- Heavily fortified but vulnerable to air/artillery
- Malinta Tunnel = command center and last refuge
- Battery positions controlled Manila Bay entrance
- After Bataan fell, artillery from Mariveles Mountains could bombard it

**Wainwright held for nearly a month** after Bataan (Apr 9 - May 6)

### **Note on Your Lolo**:
Sulpicio was **NOT on Corregidor** - he surrendered on Bataan April 9
- Corregidor garrison separate
- Different fate (though also POWs)
- Your lolo on **Bataan Death March** starting April 10

- Landing beaches marked with dates/arrows
- Japanese advance routes from beaches
- US defensive positions
- Battery locations under attack
- Movement toward Malinta Hill objective

### **Key Timeline Events**:

**May 5, 1942 - NIGHT**:
- **Kitano's assault commences**
- Defenders employ few remaining batteries
- Sink number of boats, inflict hundreds of casualties
- **61st Regiment runs to island in dark**
- **Comes ashore further east than expected**
- Immediately pushes west toward Malinta Hill
- Pushes south against Monkey Point

**May 6, 1942 - EARLY HOURS**:
- **Japanese take Battery Denver**
- Swiftly defeat marines
- **Threaten Malinta Tunnels**

**Moore reinforces** tunnel entrance under artillery fire

**Japanese fend off three consecutive counterattacks**

**Howard's last reserves** (provisional battalion: 500 marines, sailors, soldiers):
- **Last counterattack at 06:00**
- Obstinate and bold, makes gains
- Eventually stalled, forced to retreat

**Situation bad for Japanese too**:
- Ammunition crates never made landings
- Attacks made using **bayonets only**
- American batteries destroyed ~31 vessels
- **Prevents second wave landing** unless Malinta Hill taken

## **Summary: Maps in Story Order**

For understanding **Sulpicio Maglanoc's experience**, use maps in this sequence:

1. **Disposition of U.S. Army Forces** (Dec 8) - Where he started
2. **Japanese Operations on Luzon** (Dec 8-31) - The retreat he participated in
3. **Situation on Bataan** (Jan 8) - Where he ended up (Abucay Line)
4. **Orion-Bagac Line** (Jan 27-Apr 3) - **Where he held the line for 2+ months**
5. **Mount Samat** (Apr 3-6) - The bombardment that broke defenses
6. **Japanese Advance** (Apr 7-9) - **The final collapse, his surrender**

**NOT Corregidor** - different garrison, your lolo was on Bataan

## **Using These Maps for Your Project**

### **For Article/Video Scripts**:
- Reference specific map when describing event
- Example: "As shown on the Orion-Bagac Line map, the 57th Infantry PS held the eastern sector..."

### **For Visual Overlays**:
- Use maps as backgrounds for animated sequences
- Highlight specific unit positions (57th PS) as you narrate

### **For Understanding Lolo's Experience**:
- Maps 7-11 show **exactly where he fought**
- Map 9 (Orion-Bagac) is **the most important** - this is where he held for months
- Map 11 (Japanese Advance Apr 7-9) shows **his final days before surrender**
