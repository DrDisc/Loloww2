---

## **Battle of the Points (January 22 - February 13, 1942)**

**Homma's plan**: Naval landing to bypass defenses, capture Mariveles naval base, cut off retreat

**Force**: Two battalions from 20th Regiment

### **January 22, 1942 - NIGHT**
- Landing craft depart Morong toward Caibobo Point (south of Bagac)

- Closest threat to Mariveles eliminated
- **Quinauan and Anyasan Points still in Japanese hands**

### **February 1, 1942**
- **Homma sends last reinforcements at night** to secure Quinauan Point
- Fail to land at objective due to:
  - 4 remaining P-40s aerial assault
  - Intense artillery barrage
  - **US PT boats sink half the Japanese force**
- Force goes ashore at **Canas Point** instead

**600 Japanese at Quinauan now alone**, slowly concede territory at high cost

### **February 5, 1942**

## **Battle of the Pockets (February 6-20, 1942)**

**Situation**: General Morioka's forces break through 1st Division jungle positions (west)
- Force split into two pockets behind enemy lines:
  - **Big Pocket** (blocks north-south traffic, hinders westward troop movement)
  - **Little Pocket**

### **February 6, 1942**
- **Morioka launches general offensive** to reestablish supply route with Big Pocket
- Uses newly-arrived battalion of 33rd Regiment
- Initial success: breaks main defender line, gets close to Big Pocket
- **Wainwright's men stop the advance**
- Americans concentrate on reducing pockets (at great cost)

**Fighting**: Even with tanks and cordon, ferocious Japanese can't be subdued

### **February 9, 1942**

---

## **The Lull (February 20 - April 2, 1942)**

**Over a month of little fighting**

**Both sides weakened**:
- Malaria, dysentery, starvation affect both armies
- Especially heavy toll on Japanese
- Two entire Japanese battalions destroyed at Battle of the Points
- Homma forced to withdraw all engaged forces along Orion-Bagac Line

**Homma's humiliation**:
- Only Japanese commander defeated so far
- Tokyo allows him to prove worth with:
  - Fresh 4th Division (from Shanghai)
  - Much-needed siege artillery
  - **Nagano Detachment**

### **March 15, 1942**
- **4th Division arrives in Philippines**
- Homma ready for final assault

**American situation**:
- Spirits up after successful defense
- **Lack of food and medicine due to blockade leaves them weaker daily**
- **Food rations cut by 50%** in last two weeks of fighting
- 26th Cavalry horses slaughtered for meat
- Efforts to break blockade fruitless - no naval resources

**Washington response**:
- Roosevelt and Marshall try to supply MacArthur
- **Too little for MacArthur, who feels abandoned**

**MacArthur becomes war hero**:
- Personal media coverage team boosts image
- Safety paramount for American morale

### **February 22, 1942**
- **Roosevelt orders MacArthur to leave Philippines**
- Take command in Australia and Southwest Pacific Area
- MacArthur chooses to remain as long as possible (avoid demoralizing troops)

### **March 12, 1942 - MACARTHUR DEPARTS**
- Travels first to Mindanao, then flies to Australia
- Before leaving:
  - Assigns Visayan Force to Brig. Gen. Bradford Chynoweth (allows Sharp to focus on Mindanao)
  - Orders Maj. Gen. George Moore to prepare Corregidor for final stand if Bataan falls
- **General Wainwright left in command** of Philippines forces
- Final order: Fight as long as troops can resist

### **March 17, 1942**
- **MacArthur arrives at Adelaide**
- Famous words: **"I Shall Return"**
- Becomes rallying cry for Americans
- **Filipino morale declines** - MacArthur's departure hurts confidence

**Command changes**:
- I Corps assigned to General Jones (former South Luzon Force commander)
- Overall Bataan command: **Major-General Edward King** (former artillery commander)

**End of March**:
- Defenses along Orion-Bagac Line improved
- Half-starved, poorly-equipped Filipino soldiers enhance jungle warfare training

---

## **Final Assault on Bataan (April 3-9, 1942)**

### **Homma's Plan**

**Three-pronged assault** on narrow front around **Mount Samat** (key terrain)

**After breaking Samat**: Push to Mount Limay, then Mariveles

**Based on incorrect assumption**: Defenders have three defensive lines (defense in depth)
- Homma expects assault to take over a month

**Main assault - 4th Division** (Lt. Gen. Kitano Kenzo) + 65th Independent Mixed Brigade (Gen. Nara):
- **Nara**: Advance west up Pantingan River → Mariveles Mountains
- **4th Division Right Wing**: Cross Tiawir River → down Catmon Valley → Samat
- **4th Division Left Wing**: Advance directly east toward Mount Samat

**Kitano's estimate**: Once Samat taken, only pursuit required (more optimistic than Homma)

**Supporting attacks**:
- **16th Division (Gen. Morioka)**: Feint attack to pin down I Corps
- **Nagano Detachment**: Feint landings on eastern coast (cover right flank)

### **End of March 1942**
- **Heavy air and artillery attacks** on American positions begin

### **March 28, 1942**
- Homma orders final preparations
- Japanese units move to battle positions

### **March 30, 1942**
- **16th Division starts feint attacks** against 1st Sector

### **April 2, 1942**
- **Preparations complete** for final assault

### **April 3, 1942 - THE BOMBARDMENT**

**Dawn** - **6-hour air and artillery barrage** on Mount Samat area
- **Most devastating bombardment of the war**
- **Over 60 tons of bombs** dropped on defenders
- Destroys many recently-constructed defenses
- **Weakens three entire regiments**

**Afternoon** - **Barrage achieves objective** - invaders begin advance

**Forces engaged**:
- **Nara** confronts bulk of 41st Division
- **Kitano** faces 21st Division (Brig. Gen. Mateo Capinpin)
- 65th Brigade elements engage 2nd Philippine Constabulary (prevent aid to II Corps)

**Nara's main effort**: Center of 41st Division
- Quickly pushes down 42nd Regiment
- **Expects heavy opposition but finds none** (bombardment success)
- Continues southward

**Right Wing**: Crosses Tiawir, engages 21st Regiment
- Rapidly scatters them
- Continues south

**By nightfall**: Both forces advance up to 1,000 yards without strong resistance
- Bombardment devastated morale and organization

**Parker's response**: Sends 33rd Regiment to stop Japanese advance (area between Samat and Catmon River)

### **April 4, 1942 - DAY 2**

**Dawn** - Renewed air and artillery bombardment

**Results**:
- Remnants of 42nd and 43rd Regiments **flee south in stampede**
- Only 3 regiments left to stem Japanese offensive
- Despite courageous resistance, no match for superior firepower
- **Forced to retreat south** to prevent more losses

**Left Wing goes into action**:
- Attacks 22nd and 23rd Regiments
- Forces them to retreat

**Artillery chaos**: Hitting friendly and enemy units alike, can't stop advance

**By day's end**:
- **Japanese possess entire main line of resistance**
- **Right Wing reaches northern foothills of Samat**

**King's response**: Sends 31st Regiment to reinforce + places 45th and 57th Regiments on readiness nearby

### **April 5, 1942 - EASTER SUNDAY - MOUNT SAMAT FALLS**

**Morning** - 4th Division reorganizes for attack on Mount Samat

**Plan**:
- **Right Wing**: Seize heights of mountain → continue south to Tala River
- **Left Wing**: Execute main attack against Samat

**After customary bombardment**:
- Kitano starts assault
- **Finds strong resistance from Capinpin's men**
- **Right Wing advances unopposed** toward northwest slopes of Samat
- Forces American artillery to retreat

**Without artillery support**:
- Defenders concede terrain
- **Left Wing pushes them back**

**Right Wing advances**:
- Reaches southern slopes of Samat
- **Captures many 21st Division soldiers including General Capinpin**

**By nightfall**:
- **Mount Samat under Japanese control**
- Right Wing advances west, fully routing 21st Division headquarters
- **Nara continues drive south toward Mariveles**
- 16th Division and Nagano Detachment prepare to attack Mount Limay

**King's plan**: Launch **four-pronged counterattack** to regain main line (new reinforcements arrived)

**Homma's plan**: Attack eastward against 51st Division and 32nd Regiment → push southeast to Limay River

### **April 6, 1942 - DISASTER**

**Dawn** - Both sides put plans in motion

**American counterattack ends in complete disaster within a day**:

1. **31st Regiment** (alone, since 21st Division routed):
   - Attacks Samat alone
   - Despite tenacity, bulk of Left Wing falls upon them
   - **Forced on defensive**

2. **33rd Regiment** (center):
   - Rear disappears against savage Japanese forces
   - **Completely encircled by 65th Brigade**

3. **41st Regiment** (west):
   - Initially fares better
   - **Nara counterattacks, forces them back to Pantingan River**

4. **45th Regiment** (most successful):
   - **YOUR LOLO'S LIKELY UNIT**
   - Overcomes Japanese resistance
   - Continues advance north toward 41st Regiment
   - **But counterattack clearly a failure**

**Japanese success**:
- **Nara cuts off 2nd Sector from 1st**
- Advanced so far that 65th Brigade elements engage **57th Regiment** (Philippine Scouts)
- **Kitano sends 37th Regiment + tanks** against 51st Division
- Quickly overruns positions, forces retreat behind San Vicente River
- 31st Regiment also forced to withdraw
- 45th Regiment withdraws to avoid encirclement

**By day's end**: Truly disastrous
- **Loss of two divisions**
- **Complete breakdown of main line of defense**

### **April 7, 1942 - MUCH WORSE**

**Failed counterattack** to reestablish connection with I Corps (45th and 57th Regiments)

**Homma capitalizes on gains**:
- **Kitano spots gap** between southern San Vicente line and 57th Regiment
- **Sends 61st Regiment to endanger American flanks**
- **Highly successful** - forces 57th Regiment to retreat eastward

**Isolated 33rd Regiment**:
- Despite strong, fierce resistance
- **Finally routed**
- Only few escape through jungles

**Main assault by 4th Division + Nagano Detachment**:
- Strike directly at demoralized defenders on San Vicente River
- Under relentless bombardment
- **Filipinos on right break** - unorganized retreat begins
- Americans on left fare slightly better
- **8th Regiment assault sends them packing too**

**General King sends 26th Cavalry Regiment** (recently arrived from I Corps) to cover withdrawal toward Mamala River
- **Cavalrymen tenaciously resist** Kitano's assault
- **8th Regiment encircles them**
- **Forced to retreat behind river**

**Afternoon** - New line formed on Mamala River
- **Invaders immediately hammer defenders**
- **Americans retreat south toward Alangan River**

**Wainwright's desperation**: Orders 11th Division to attack eastward and save II Corps
- **Task impossible, already too late**

**General Jones forced to withdraw** toward Binuangan River to relink with Parker's line

**Situation completely chaotic for defenders**

### **April 8, 1942 - FINAL DAY**

**Homma continues drive** against Mariveles and Cabcaben

**Decimated Filipino forces continually retreat** due to:
- Strong bombardment
- Heavy pressure from Kitano's men

**Clear now**:
- **II Corps fully disintegrated**
- **End is nigh for Battling Bastards of Bataan**

**Chaos**: Order from MacArthur to attack Olongapo received
- **King dismisses it** - impossible to execute
- **Orders demolition of equipment and facilities**

**King's decision**:
- Holds responsibility for fate of 78,000 men on Bataan
- **Surrender is only option** - even if Wainwright or MacArthur order otherwise

**Few units escape** - most too far from Mariveles

**Homma hears of possible evacuation**:
- **Sends tank vanguard rushing to Mariveles**

### **April 9, 1942 - NOON - SURRENDER OF BATAAN**

**Japanese tanks reach American headquarters**
- **Received with white flags**

**King surrenders**
- After several months, **Bataan has fallen**
- Asks Maj. Gen. Kameichiro Nagano for assurance: treat men as prisoners of war
- **Nagano's response**: "The Imperial Japanese Army are not barbarians"

**Another army vanished** against Japanese Empire

## **The Bataan Death March (April 9-24, 1942)**

**~85,000 prisoners captured** (Americans and Filipinos)

**Route**: Mariveles airfield (assembly point) → San Fernando → Camp O'Donnell (Capas, Tarlac)

### **Segment 1: Mariveles to San Fernando (On Foot)**

**Distance**: ~94 km (58 miles)
**Conditions**:
- No food or water
- Pitted, dusty road
- Sparse Japanese guards/escorts
- Hot sun

**Treatment**:
- Denied food and water
- Robbed of possessions and equipment
- Maimed, beaten, bayoneted
- Many died of starvation, exhaustion, sickness

**Horror**:
- Ditches strewn with weak, sick, dying
- Those who sat down were bayoneted for "refusing to march"

### **Segment 2: San Fernando to Capas (Railroad)**

**Distance**: ~40 km (25 miles)
**Conditions**:
- Freight trains (airless type)
- **As many as 115 packed in each car**
- Men could only stand, wedged like cigarettes in pack
- Boxcars remained closed (prevent escapes)

**Result**:
- Many died of suffocation
- Each car with quota of dead

### **Segment 3: Capas to Camp O'Donnell (On Foot)**

**Distance**: ~8 miles final trek to camp

**Death toll estimates**:
- **5,000-18,000 Filipino deaths**
- **500-650 American deaths**

**This is only the beginning** - three years of mistreatment for survivors

---

## **Camp O'Donnell (April-May 1942)**

**Japanese unprepared** for such influx of prisoners

**Conditions**:
- No logistics or facilities for this population
- Scarcity of food and water
- Lack of cleaning materials, medicine, hospital equipment
- Weakened men from Death March

**Food**:
- Meager amounts of spoiled, moldy rice
- Contaminated water from river (~4 inches deep)
- Slimy mud with overflow from pit latrines
- Only scum of water on top

**By end of April**:
- Men on bare floors, sick and hungry
- **Hundreds dying every day**

**Maj. Gen. Rafael Jalandoni** later reported:
- **43,000 Filipinos reached Camp O'Donnell alive**
- **29,000 of them died there** before he was released

**American prisoners**: ~5,000 died during first year

### **Later prisoner movements**:

**Fall of Corregidor**: American prisoners transferred to camps near Cabanatuan (somewhat better conditions)

**120 senior officers** (including General Wainwright): Taken to camp near Tarlac City

**September 1942 - January 1943**: Japan paroles remaining Filipino prisoners
- Forced to sign oath not to become guerrillas

**Remaining Americans**:
- Too weak to send abroad: distributed across Philippines
- Strong enough: sent on "hell ships" to:
  - Japan
  - Manchuria
  - Korea
  - Taiwan
  - Forced hard labor until war's end

**Wainwright**: Sent to Formosa, later Manchuria
- Became thin and malnourished
- Suffered Japanese mistreatments
- **Highest-ranking prisoner of war**

---

## **Fall of Corregidor (April 10 - May 6, 1942)**

### **The Fortress**

**General Wainwright's garrison**: ~13,000 men
- Including 4th Marines Regiment (Colonel Samuel Howard)

**"Gibraltar of the East"**:
- Heavily fortified but not improved since WWI
- **Armament**:
  - 56 coastal guns and mortars
  - 48 machine guns
  - 28 3-inch guns
  - 10 Sperry searchlights

**Harbor Defenses** (General Moore):
- Protect beaches
- Execute inshore patrols
- Includes Corregidor + 3 other fortified islands in Manila Bay

**Critical weaknesses**:
- Vulnerability to air attacks
- Vulnerable on landward flanks
- Moore lacked time to update fortifications

**Food shortage**: Living on 30 ounces food per day
- When bombardments killed cavalry horses, men dragged carcasses to mess hall for consumption

### **December 28, 1941 - January 6, 1942**
- **Regularly bombarded** by Lt. Gen. Obata Hideyoshi's air forces
- Heavy damage, morale drop
- **Armament kept unscathed** (luckily)

### **February 1942**
- **Japanese artillery from Cavite** intermittently shells positions
- Fails to cause severe damage

### **March 15, 1942**
- **New reinforcements arrive** for heavier bombardment from Pico de Loro
- Causes much damage to **Forts Frank and Drum**

### **April 9, 1942 - FALL OF BATAAN**
- **Homma places heavy artillery on slopes of Mariveles Mountains**
- Can now inflict real damage on American defenses

### **April 10 - May 5, 1942 - THE SIEGE**

**27 days of siege**

**Major-General Kitajima Kineo's artillery**: 18 batteries, ~116 field pieces

**Objectives**:
- Neutralize enemy guns
- Destroy Corregidor installations
- Sink vessels in bay
- Destroy anti-aircraft guns and short-range batteries (allow aircraft close approach)
- Drown out noise of transports' engines entering Manila Bay through North Channel

**Result**:
- **Artillery unleashes hell with great effectiveness**
- Heavy fire craters land
- Most beach defenses demolished
- Anti-aircraft guns destroyed
- **Impossible to repair or replace defenses** (shelling never stops)

**Aerial bombardments** (22nd Air Brigade):
- Emboldened by artillery success
- Come in at lower altitudes
- Bomb more accurately
- Increase damage

**By start of May**:
- Large sections shrouded in smoke and dust
- **Even heavier pre-assault bombardment commences**

**Only safe place**: Malinta Tunnels
- But can't fight back from there

**Concentrated fire on narrow tail** hints at assault location
- Harshness leaves area very vulnerable

**Intensity increases daily** to defenders' disbelief

### **May 5, 1942 - EVE OF ASSAULT**
- **Defenses truly destroyed**
- Dust so heavy men can't see beyond their position

**By April 22**: Japanese assembled ~60 transports in bay (noise drowned by artillery)

### **May 5, 1942 - NIGHT - THE ASSAULT BEGINS**

**Kitano's assault force**: 4th Division reinforced with:
- 7th Tank Regiment
- 1 battalion mountain artillery

**16th Division**: Launch feint attack from Cavite against Forts Frank and Drum

**Night assault**:
- **Defenders valiantly employ few remaining batteries**
- Manage to sink number of boats
- **Inflict hundreds of casualties**

**61st Regiment runs to island in dark**:
- **Comes ashore further east than expected**
- Immediately pushes west toward Malinta Hill
- Pushes south against Monkey Point

### **May 6, 1942 - EARLY HOURS**
- **Japanese take Battery Denver position**
- Swiftly defeat US Marines opposition
- **Threaten Malinta Tunnels**

**Moore reinforces** tunnel entrance under heavy artillery fire

**Japanese fend off three consecutive counterattacks** against their position

**Colonel Howard's desperation**: Sends last reserves
- Provisional battalion: 500 marines, sailors, soldiers
- **Last counterattack at 06:00**

**American attack**: Obstinate and bold
- Makes gains (surprises Japanese)
- Eventually stalled
- **Defenders forced to retreat**

**Situation bad for Japanese too**:
- Several ammunition crates never made landings
- Several attacks/counterattacks made using **bayonets only**
- American battery retaliation destroyed ~31 vessels
- **Prevents Kitano from launching second wave** (37th Regiment) unless Malinta Hill taken first

**61st Regiment assembles** with tanks and artillery
- Starts coordinated assault
- **Rapidly routs marine defenders**

### **May 6, 1942 - 10:00 - SURRENDER**

**Situation hopeless**

**Wainwright's decision**:
- Knows wholesale slaughter will occur if Japanese reach tunnels
- **No choice but to surrender**
- Surrenders **four fortified islands in Manila Bay**

**While Wainwright travels to Bataan**:
- **Japanese seize Malinta Tunnels**
- Leave men there to their mercy

**Homma forces Wainwright**:
- Initially reluctant to surrender rest of Philippines
- Threatened: 11,000 men in Corregidor could be brutally executed
- **Forced to order Visayan-Mindanao forces to surrender**

---

## **Southern Philippines Operations (April-June 1942)**

### **Mindanao Situation**

**General Sharp's forces**:
- 3 poorly-equipped, inadequately-trained Filipino divisions
- Few artillery pieces
- Additional division being organized at Cagayan

**Defense sectors**: Five total
- Most important: Cotabato-Davao Sector (Japanese already there since Dec 1941)

**Japanese presence**: Battalion-strong Miura Detachment (Lt. Col. Miura Toshio)
- Small presence at Davao
- Tried to extend control into interior (unsuccessful despite air/artillery support)

**Homma's plan** (after fall of Panay/Cebu): Seize island with coordinated attack from three directions
- **Miura**: Move to Digos → strike toward Sayre Highway
- **Kawaguchi Detachment**: Land Cotabato (west coast) → small force east to link with Miura, bulk push north to Cagayan
- **Kawamura Detachment**: Land Macajalar Bay (head) → small force west to meet Kawaguchi, rest march south along Sayre Highway

**Goal**: Encircle and neutralize American defenders across three fronts

### **April 26, 1942**
- **Kawaguchi Detachment departs Cebu** toward Cotabato

### **April 29, 1942 - HIROHITO'S BIRTHDAY**

**Dawn** - Kawaguchi's men land at Cotabato and Parang

**Cotabato**: Come ashore unharmed

**Parang**: Much more opposition
- 1st Regiment (Colonel Calixto Duque) established solid beach defenses
- **Hold town for 6+ hours**

**Despite landing without problem at Cotabato**:
- Kawaguchi sees heavy resistance entering city
- Pushes Filipinos back with aircraft aid

**Result**:
- Both Calixto's men and 101st Division **find themselves encircled**
- **Must withdraw inland**

**Miura**: Moves against Digos in strength
- Engages Filipino forces
- Starts advance west toward Sayre Highway
- Defenders (Lt. Col. Reed Graves) oppose stubbornly
- Effectively slow Japanese with mortar fire

### **April 30, 1942**
- **Kawaguchi advances eastward** toward Miura (overland + sailing up river)
- **Dangerous**: Japanese can set up roadblocks in front of retreating 101st Division
- **Japanese capture Pikit**, force Filipinos north away from roads
- **Kawaguchi wants to advance on Kabacan** (completely cut off Graves)
- **Race starts for heart of sector**

**Kawaguchi also advances from Parang toward Malabang**:
- Held by 61st Regiment (Colonel Eugene Mitchell)
- **Defenders withdraw to better positions behind Mataling River**
- **Action opens along Mataling line**
- Filipinos hold for few hours
- Suffer heavy casualties
- **Start to give way** against incessant hammering

**Mitchell launches counterattack** against weakened rear:
- Japanese artillery arrives
- Filipino soldiers reluctant to attack
- **Forces retreat**

### **May 1, 1942**
- **61st engaged again** by Kawaguchi
- **Heavy casualties**
- **Continue withdrawal northward**

**Reinforced by elements of 84th Regiment**:
- **Third Japanese assault overruns and routs defenders**

**Mitchell retreats, reorganizes** remainder with detachment of 81st Regiment:
- **Hot on heels, Japanese strike**
- **Finally annihilate Filipino force**
- **Capture Mitchell**

**Kawaguchi aims at Ganassi**: 73rd Regiment (Lt. Col. Robert Vesey) stands as last obstacle to Cagayan

### **May 2, 1942**
- **Kawaguchi's vanguard starts preliminary assault** at Ganassi
- Rapidly forces defenders to withdraw toward Bacolod
- Japanese don't keep pressure

**Meanwhile**: After successful delaying actions against Miura Detachment
- **Graves ordered to withdraw immediately** (or get annihilated)
- **By hair's breadth, Filipinos escape through Kabacan** just as town being attacked
- Set up defensive positions along Sayre Highway
- **Successfully hold ground** against invaders until end of campaign

### **May 3, 1942 - NORTHERN MINDANAO**

**Early morning** - Kawaguchi resumes advance toward Cagayan
- **Abruptly stopped by 73rd's successful delaying actions**
- One IJA tank attempts to cross stream - **knocked out by 2.95" mountain gun**
- 73rd shoots out IJA, halting them

**Despite success**: Japanese receive artillery support
- **Sends defenders packing**

**Victory**: Kawaguchi consolidates control over southern and western Mindanao
- Only leaves Filipinos on north standing

**Early hours** - Kawamura Detachment lands at two points (northern Mindanao)
- Supported by destroyers and aircraft
- Quickly come ashore
- Successfully push back defenders

**Strong counterattack by 103rd Regiment**:
- Almost drives invaders back into sea
- Retreat of other 102nd Division elements forces regiment to withdraw

**General Sharp**: Sends reserves to halt Japanese advance along Sayre Highway

**By nightfall**: New defensive positions established parallel to Mangima Canyon
- 3 regiments hold Dalirig
- 2 regiments defend Puntian

**Kawamura decides not to continue advance** - defenders can dig in

### **May 6, 1942**
- **Wainwright's surrender order**

### **May 9, 1942**
- **Kawamura resumes offensive** with attack against Dalirig
- Makes little progress

**May 9**: Town finally taken as 62nd Regiment retreats in disarray
- **Effectively breaches Mangima line**
- **Northern Mindanao in Japanese hands**

**General Sharp's dilemma**:
- Ignore surrender order = hostages on Corregidor massacred
- Men still capable of guerrilla warfare

**Result**: Several smaller groups released from command
- Remaining defenders retreat to mountain hideouts

### **May 10-15, 1942**
- **Wainwright's surrender orders arrive** to scattered Filipino forces
- **Generals Sharp and Chynoweth surrender** (among many others) to avoid Corregidor garrison slaughter
- **Many officers refuse** - continue to fight as guerrilla groups (mostly Filipino soldiers)

**Most guerrillas continue to fight until liberation** - prove pivotal for future operations

### **Last to surrender: Negros Island**
- Filipino forces mutiny against commander
- Hold hostage ~200 Japanese internees

### **June 3, 1942**
- Most Filipinos surrender
- **Two battalions never surrender** - continue fight from mountains

---

## **Campaign Conclusion**

**Fall of Philippines completed** after six months of long resistance

**Archipelago now in Japanese hands**

**Homma's fate**:
- Finally won campaign
- **Tokyo expected this by February (2 months, not 5)**
- **Promptly and disgracefully relieved from command**

**For the Allies**:
- **Epic of Bataan and Corregidor acts as beacon of hope**
- Proved Japanese not really unstoppable

**Strategic impact**:
- Long American-Filipino resistance **tied up large amount of Japanese troops, aircraft, resources**
- Could not be employed elsewhere (particularly dangerous invasion of Australia)
- **Allied forces gained enough time** for improvement of Australia and New Guinea defenses
- **Same defenses later stop Japanese advance** on South Pacific

## **The Occupation and Resistance (May 1942 - October 1944)**

### **Japanese Military Administration**

**Established at Manila** - immediately seeks collaboration government

**Expected**: Immediate Filipino compliance

### **End of January 1942**
- Threat: Philippine independence granted "so long as it cooperates"
- **Filipino leaders constitute Provisional Philippine Council of State**
- Under Jorge Vargas (Mayor of Manila)
- **Huge political victory for Japanese**

**Reasons for cooperation**:
- Genuine sense of responsibility toward civilians
- Mood of fear, disillusion, abandonment
- Japanese threatening and cajoling leaders

**Most kept in active government service until war ended**

**However**:
- **Commonwealth government in exile** (Quezon in Washington) remains government for most Filipinos
- Commands allegiance despite isolation
- **Japanese failure to bend Filipino allegiance** = defeat greater than military successes

### **Japanese Brutality**

**"Comfort women"**:
- **More than 1,000 Filipinos imprisoned**
- Mothers, girls, gay men (some aged 10)
- **Kept in sexual slavery** for Japanese military
- Each installation had "comfort station"
- **Kidnapped from population**
- Routinely gang-raped, tortured, humiliated
- Breasts cut off, damaging wounds when fighting back
- Many murdered and disposed like animals

**Human experimentation**:
- Japanese "doctors" and "surgeons" sent to Philippines
- Performed experiments on native Filipinos:
  - Amputations
  - Dissections
  - Suturing blood vessels of live humans

### **Resistance Begins**

**Due to Filipino discontent**: Resistance erupts across country
- Guerrilla groups form
- Active underground movements

---

## **Filipino Guerrilla Resistance (1942-1944)**

### **Before Japanese Military Administration Established**

**Independent civilian-led armed resistance groups** hit Japanese behind lines (North Luzon, Bicol):

**Founded December 1941**:
- **Walter Cushing** (American miner)
- **Governor Roque Ablan** (Ilocos Norte)
- **Governor Marcelo Adduru** (Cagayan)
- **George Scholey** (American mining engineer)
- **Governor Wenceslao Vinzons** (Camarines Norte, Bicols)

**Result**: Most groups later wiped out, but 1942 raids huge thorn for Japanese still fighting on Bataan

### **Before Fall of Bataan**

**MacArthur appeals** (USAFFE Voice of Freedom): Filipinos organize resistance to relieve pressure on Bataan/Corregidor

**Response (following months)**:
- **Dr. Higinio Mendoza**: Guerrilla movement in Palawan
- **Jose Banal**: Resistance unit in Minalin, Pampanga
- **Marcos Villa Agustín** (professional boxer): Marking Guerrillas in Talbak, Antipolo
- **First Provisional Guerrilla Regiment**: Formed in North Luzon
- **Many guerrilla groups**: Formed in Bicol

**Lt. Col. Claude Thorpe**: Ordered in February to leave Bataan
- Proceed north to establish coordinated guerrilla force on Luzon
- Conduct raid on Japanese-held Clark Field
- Initial success at Zambales
- **Efforts prove fruitless** - fails to organize different Luzon guerrillas

### **March 1942 - The Huks**

**Mount Arayat, Pampanga**: Group forms military phase of United Front political party

**Name translates**: "People's Army Against the Japanese"

**Structure**:
- **Huk Military Committee** at apex
- Direct guerrilla campaign
- Lead revolution to seize power after war

**Luis Taruc** (communist leader, peasant-organizer):
- Elected head of committee
- First Huk commander "El Supremo"

**Begin as**: Five 100-man units

**Reinforced by**:
- Jose Banal's unit
- Communist Chinese Wha Chi unit

**Grow to**: ~15,000 armed fighters by war's end (well-trained, highly organized)

### **After Fall of Bataan**

**Many evade capture**, join resistance:

**Captain Bernard Anderson**: Forms guerrilla battalion at Tayabas

**Lieutenants Robert Lapham and Edwin Ramsay**: Organize resistance in East Central Luzon

**Zambales Resistance Movement** consolidates:
- **Captain Ramon Magsaysay** inducted (future Philippine President)
- Conducts limited sabotage
- Attends to Japanese-hired spies

**September 1942**: Thorpe captured around Pampanga, later executed
- Leaves only Lapham and Ramsay to command East Central Luzon Guerrilla Area

**North Luzon survivors**:
- **Colonels Martin Moses and Arthur Noble** (one group)
- **Major Russell Volckmann and Captain Donald Blackburn** (another group)
- Slip from Bataan to Cordilleras of North Luzon

**July 1942**: Moses assumes command over all North Luzon guerrillas
- Prepares coordinated attacks/ambushes for October

**Hunters ROTC Guerrillas** (Rizal):
- Undergraduates led by Lt. Miguel Ver and 20-year-old Eleuterio Adevoso
- Move to Zigzag, Banaba, finally Malabanca (Antipolo)
- **Japanese ambush kills Ver**
- Adevoso takes over, regroups to Bosoboso Valley
- Train new recruits aided by Markings

**August 31, 1942**: Hunters successfully ambush Japanese convoy at Pugad Lawin
- Boosts morale
- Expansion into Rizal, Laguna, Tayabas provinces

### **After Fall of Corregidor - Mindanao**

**Engineer Wendell Fertig**: Goes to hills of Kolambugan (Lanao) with Captain Luis Morgan
- Recruits and organizes guerrillas in Lanao and Misamis Occidental

**Cotabato Valley**: Japanese reign of terror incites Muslim Moro population
- Form guerrillas under **Datu Salipada Pendatun**

**Sulu Archipelago**: Guerrillas emerge

**Zamboanga**: 8 officers + ~100 men form various guerrillas

**Davao**: Captain Claro Laureta organizes civilian refugees along Libuganon River

### **After Fall of Corregidor - Visayas**

**Wainwright's surrender order** forces most commanding officers to turn themselves in

**Panay**: After Colonel Christie surrenders
- **Colonel Macario Peralta Jr.** organizes Free Panay Guerrilla Force
- Support of **Governor Tomas Confesor's** hidden civil government

**Palawan**: More guerrilla forces emerge, unified under Panay central command

**Negros**: 
- **Majors Salvador Abcede and Ernesto Mata** refuse surrender
- Continue guerrilla warfare

**Cebu**: After General Chynoweth's surrender
- Most of 81st Division reorganizes into guerrilla unit under **Engineer James Cushing**

**Bohol**: Guerrillas unify under **Lieutenant Ismael Ingeniero**

**Leyte**: Many guerrilla organizations fight Tacloban garrison

**Samar**: Two main guerrillas
- **Captain Pedro Merritt** (north)
- **Captain Manuel Valley** (south)

**Masbate**: Captain Manuel Donato unifies 3 main guerrillas into single battalion
- Almost complete control over island

**Mindoro**: Resistance unproductive due to strife/friction among groups

### **1942 Guerrilla Activities**

**Year of consolidation**:
- Groups establish in respective areas
- Fight to survive with local population support
- Conduct raids against Japanese garrisons + Kempeitai police

**August 1942**: Salipada Pendatun attacks/wipes out small garrison in Pikit (Cotabato)
- Seizes and controls Sayre Highway (Kabacan to Digos)
- Reinforced by **Moro-Bolo Battalion of Datu Gumball Piang**: 20,000 fighting men with large bolos and kris
- Helps Bukidnon guerrillas drive out Japanese from Kibawe, Maramag, Valencia, Mailag by year end

**August 24, 1942**: Peralta opens offensive
- Preliminary attack on Japanese garrison at Calmay
- Kills 20 Japanese, steals 1,000 rounds ammunition

**August 26**: Resistance civil government ambushes Japanese at San Nicolas mountain pass

**Result**: Guerrilla strikes loosen Japanese foothold on Panay

**August 31**: Japanese leave Kalibo  
**September 5**: Guerrillas liberate Dumangas  
**September**: 6 more towns fall to Peralta  
**October 20**: Pototan (Iloilo) freed

**Panay now**: Almost Japanese-free territory with re-established, fully functioning civil government

**Shortly after**: Peralta initiates call for unification of all Visayas resistance under Panay leadership
- Amenable responses from Negros, Leyte, Samar, Cebu, Bohol
- Creates **4th Philippines Corps** with himself as commander
- Actual coordination proves difficult

**Moses' October offensive**: Ends in complete failure
- **MacArthur radio order to "lie low" in 1943**
- Received by most units, not fully obeyed
- Some hunted by Japanese/puppet spies/constabularies
- Others continue resistance and raiding

### **1943 Guerrilla Consolidation**

**Fertig tasks Morgan**: Unite all known guerrilla groups across Mindanao

**January 12, 1943**: Morgan departs Misamis with party of 80 men
- Moves across northern Mindanao, Leyte, Negros
- Attempts to unify different units
- **Efforts largely fruitless** - only gains recognition of Zamboanga and Bukidnon guerrillas

**Fertig's strategy**: Uses theory of lineal seniority, assumes rank of **Brigadier-General**

**Pendatun does same thing** - refuses to follow Fertig's orders

**February 18, 1943**: Captain Charles Smith returns aboard submarine Trout
- Accompanied by Lt. Cmdr Charles Parsons
- ~7 tons assorted supplies

**Parsons convinces Fertig**: Strip flag rank on promise of help from Southwest Pacific Area
- Made **Temporary-Colonel and Commanding Officer of pre-war 10th Military District** (all Mindanao)
- Rank and designation confirmed by MacArthur's HQ

**Result**: Convinces other guerrillas to join, including Pendatun (assigned rank of Major)

**Pendatun extracts concession**: Operates in area where Fertig not physically present
- Takes Lanao, Cotabato, Bukidnon as jurisdiction
- Commanding Officer of 117th Regiment

**Lt. Col. Alejandro Suarez**: Reorganizes and unifies Sulu guerrillas
- Forms 125th Regiment under Fertig's command

**Panay**: MacArthur reorganizes Peralta's 4th Philippines Corps into **6th Military District**
- Colonel Peralta as District Commander

**North Luzon**:
- **Markings**: Yay Panlilio arrives (Irish-American-Filipino mestiza)
  - Becomes Colonel and second-in-command
  - Responsible for most organization activities outside field action
  
- **Hunters**: Raid and burn Kapatalan Sawmill (Laguna)
  - Disperse to avoid Japanese retaliation

**June 9, 1943**: Colonels Moses and Noble captured in Lubuagan (Kalinga)
- **Major Volckmann assumes command** of North Luzon guerrillas
- MacArthur's orders: "...limit hostilities and contact with enemy to minimum..." as "present mission as intelligence units can be of utmost value"

### **Success of Filipino Resistance**

**Forces Japanese to**:
- Keep troops in Philippines instead of frontlines
- Lose control over many Filipino provinces

**Gains valuable intelligence** for MacArthur in Australia

### **1943 Prisoner Release Catalyst**

**Japanese question**: What to do with thousands of surviving Filipino prisoners?

**Dilemma**:
- Treat as traditional POWs = little hope of winning sympathy
- Send home without detention = trained nucleus of enormous guerrilla movement turned free
- Number of scattered weapons great = serious risk

**Initially very hostile** to Filipino soldiers:
- Japanese troops saw comrades killed by Filipinos during battle
- Behaved brutally
- Filipinos endured hardships equal to American troops severity
- Herded into makeshift camps with terrible atrocities

**Policy reversal**: Military Administration argues for pragmatic charity vs field command's brutality

**Political officers capitalize**:
- Argue: with peace, new era of Filipino-Japanese relations begun
- **Hastily constructed rehabilitation and indoctrination program** prior to discharge

**Result**: Having alienated young Filipinos, Japanese turn them loose
- **Within short period, most join guerrilla movement** (overtly or covertly)

**Example - Captain Alejo Santos**:
- Captured at Bataan
- Herded into Death March
- Escaped from prisoners' formation at Betis (Pampanga)
- **July 1942**: Brings together fellow officers, forms "Philippine Legion" at Bulacan
- **December 1943**: Consolidates all guerrilla groups in Bulacan
- **December 21**: Mediates conference between Lt. Ramsey and Capt. Anderson
  - Confirms Anderson as new commander of Luzon Guerrilla Forces

**Example - Lt. Col. Ruperto Kangleon**:
- Escapes POW camp in Agusan
- Offered unified command over Leyte guerrillas
- Convinced by Commander Parsons
- **April 20, 1943**: Reluctantly assumes command
- Immediately consolidates all guerrilla units on entire Leyte island (ample success)
- Sends Lt. Col. Juan Causing to nearby Samar to unify guerrillas (only Valley Group convinced)

**Retired and active Filipino senior officers** collaborate with guerrillas:
- Many approached to lead Japanese-sponsored Bureau of Constabulary

**Example - Brigadier-General Vicente Lim**:
- Upon release, lives in Manila
- Sent feelers to head puppet Philippine Constabulary
- **Absolutely determined not to collaborate**
- Has himself confined at Institute of Cancer building (Philippine General Hospital)
- Doctors pronounce him "sick" - ready excuse to turn down appointments
- Supposedly told enraged Filipino official: prefers death at Japanese hands rather than assassin's bullet

**Lim continues fight**:
- Personally finances various guerrilla activities in provinces
- Directs operations from PGH
- Operatives give regular weekly reports: Japanese troop movements, disposition, military installations
- **Intelligence greatly contributes** to success of American-Filipino liberation operations (1944-1945)

**Inevitably becomes target**:
- **Captured by Kenpeitai** (August 1944) while trying to escape to Negros
- Imprisoned and tortured in Fort Santiago
- **Allegedly beheaded**, buried in unknown grave

**For Your Lolo - Sulpicio P. Maglanoc**:

This timeline shows exactly what he experienced:
- **December 8, 1941**: War begins with Clark Field disaster
- **December 22-January 6**: Retreat to Bataan (likely with 45th or 57th Infantry PS)
- **January 9 - April 2**: Defense of Orion-Bagac Line (his unit specifically mentioned)
- **April 3-6**: Mount Samat bombardment and assault (his position)
- **April 6**: 45th Regiment counterattack (likely his unit)
- **April 7**: 57th Regiment forced to retreat (his area)
- **April 9**: Surrender at 78,000 men
- **April 10-24**: Bataan Death March (Mariveles → Camp O'Donnell)
- **1942-1945**: POW camp survival, lung cancer later from conditions

**He was one of the "Battling Bastards of Bataan" who held the line for 3+ months against impossible odds.**
