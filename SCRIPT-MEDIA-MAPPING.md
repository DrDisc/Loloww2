## File Organization Notes

### Duplicate Files Found:
- `Philippine_Infantry_Division_Insignia.svg` appears in 3 locations:
  - `/media/photos/insignia/`
  - `/media/graphics/insignia/`
  - `/media/insignia/carabao-division-insignia.svg`
- **Recommendation:** Consolidate to `/media/graphics/insignia/` and remove duplicates

### Missing Directories (Empty but Ready):
- `/media/footage/historical/` - Empty (awaiting NARA archival footage)
- `/media/footage/b-roll/` - Empty (ready for carabao footage download)
- `/media/graphics/diagrams/` - Empty (ready for organizational chart, tactical diagrams)
- `/media/graphics/text-overlays/` - Empty (ready for text graphics)
- `/media/music/` - Empty (awaiting music tracks)

---

**Conclusion:** Project has **66% of required media assets** with excellent map coverage (114%) but gaps in graphics (8%) and no music/footage yet. Scripts #1 and #3 are production-ready. Script #2 needs organizational chart and B-roll, both easily acquirable.

**Overall Assessment:** STRONG foundation. Can produce quality videos with current assets while filling gaps.
