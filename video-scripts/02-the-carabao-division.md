## Script

### Visual: Beautiful footage of carabao (water buffalo) in Philippine rice fields

**Narrator (VO):**
"The carabao - the Philippine water buffalo. To Filipinos, it represents strength, endurance, and the agricultural heart of the nation."

### Visual: Transition to Philippine Division insignia with carabao head

**Narrator (VO):**
"So when the US Army's Philippine Division chose their insignia in 1921, they chose the carabao. Red and gold - the colors of Spanish colonial heritage. But the carabao itself? That was purely Filipino."

**Narrator (VO):**
"When Japan invaded in December 1941, the carabao soldiers would prove their worth - holding the line on Bataan for four months against a superior force."
