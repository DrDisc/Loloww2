# Agent Guidelines for Lolo's War Project

## Project Type
Historical research and documentation repository - primarily Markdown, with future media assets and potential web frontend.

## Build/Test Commands
No build system currently configured. Future additions may include static site generators (Jekyll, Hugo, or MkDocs).

## Content Guidelines
- **File Format**: Markdown (.md) for all written content; follow CommonMark specification
- **Citations**: Use footnotes with `[^1]` format; include full bibliography in `/sources`
- **Tone**: Academic and respectful; avoid sensationalism when discussing atrocities
- **Language**: Primary English; include Tagalog/Filipino terms with translations in italics
- **Naming**: Use kebab-case for files (`bataan-death-march.md`); descriptive, not generic

## Research Standards
- **Sources**: Prioritize primary sources and reputable historians (see README.md)
- **Verification**: Cross-reference claims with multiple sources from different perspectives
- **Attribution**: Always cite sources; never present unverified claims as fact
- **Sensitivity**: Handle veteran testimonials and traumatic events with appropriate gravity

## File Organization
Follow structure in README.md: `/research`, `/drafts`, `/media`, `/video-scripts`, `/sources`, `/family`

## Historical Accuracy
When in doubt, mark claims as "reported" or "according to [source]" rather than stating as definitive fact.
