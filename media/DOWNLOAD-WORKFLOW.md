## 🚫 Known Issues & Workarounds

### If PICRYL blocks you:
- Try incognito/private browsing
- Clear cookies
- Try different browser
- Download a few at a time, take breaks

### If NARA downloads fail:
- Some images require on-site visit to NARA
- Contact NARA Research Services: archives.gov/contact
- Try alternate sources (PICRYL often has NARA images)

### If Videvo requires payment:
