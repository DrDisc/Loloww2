## **Chronological Map Order**

### **Phase 1: Japanese Invasion of Luzon (December 8-31, 1941)**
**File**: `960px-Japanese_Operations_on_Luzon_Dec_1941.jpg`

**What it shows**:
- Multiple Japanese landing points across Luzon (north at Lingayen Gulf, south near Manila)
- Red arrows indicate main drives of the Japanese 14th Army
- Progression dates: Dec 10, 12, 22-23, 27, 30, 31
- US-Filipino forces retreating to Bataan Peninsula (MacArthur's War Plan Orange-3)

**Tactical significance**:
- Classic Japanese pincer movement forcing defenders into peninsular pocket
- Manila declared an open city (Dec 26) to prevent destruction
- Successful but chaotic retreat of 80,000+ troops to Bataan
- Supply shortages began immediately - half-rations from January 1942

**Units involved**: Philippine Division (45th, 57th Infantry PS), 26th Cavalry PS, Philippine Army divisions

---

### **Phase 2: Initial Bataan Defensive Positions (January 8, 1942)**
**File**: `Situation_on_Bataan_8_Jan_1942.jpg`

**What it shows**:
- Main Battle Position along the northern Bataan defensive line
- Rear Battle Position as fallback
- Unit positions marked (41st, 51st, 57th Infantry, etc.)
- Mountainous terrain (Mt. Natib 4222 ft, Mt. Santa Rosa 3052 ft) forming natural barriers
- Corps Reserve positions

**Tactical significance**:
- Two-corps defense: I Corps (west) and II Corps (east) of Bataan
- Mt. Natib in center created gap between corps
- Japanese exploited this gap, forcing first retreat
- Mauban Line established as forward position

**Defensive challenges**:
- Malaria and dysentery already affecting troops
- Ammunition rationed from day one
- No air support (Japanese controlled skies)
- Communication difficulties between I and II Corps

---

### **Phase 3: The Mauban Line Counterattacks (January 18-25, 1942)**
**File**: `Mauban_Line.jpg`

**What it shows**:
- Black arrows = Axis of Japanese attack
- White arrows = Axis of U.S. counterattack
- Japanese roadblock (labeled) cutting supply lines
- Counterattacks by 26th Cavalry PS, 31st and 45th Infantry
- Dates showing progressive action Jan 19-24

**Tactical significance**:
- Desperate counterattacks to dislodge Japanese breakthrough
- Failed to restore Mauban Line
- Forced withdrawal to Orion-Bagac Line (main defensive position)
- Heavy casualties for Philippine Scouts units

**Note on map**: "Contoured outline of terrain configuration is incomplete, because of inadequate map coverage of this area."

### **Phase 4: The Orion-Bagac Line - Main Defense (January 27, 1942)**
**File**: `960px-Orion-Bagac_Line.jpg`

**What it shows**:
- The primary defensive line across Bataan (coast to coast)
- Blue hatched line = U.S. positions (surfaced, all-weather road)
- Partially surfaced roads and trails shown
- Unit positions: Philippine Scouts (45th, 57th PS), reserve units
- Mariveles Mountains (center) providing defensive terrain
- Elevation contours marked in feet

**Tactical significance**:
- **This is where the Philippine Scouts held for 3 months**
- Strongest defensive position - well-prepared with foxholes, trenches, artillery positions
- I Corps (west): 1st, 91st PA divisions + 26th Cavalry
- II Corps (east): 41st, 51st, 57th Infantry (Philippine Scouts), 21st, 31st Infantry
- Mt. Limay and Mariveles Mts provided anchoring terrain

**Life on the line** (Jan 27 - April 3):
- Constant artillery exchanges
- Patrol clashes and small-unit actions
- Starvation rations (1/4 normal by March)
- Disease epidemic: malaria, dengue, dysentery, beriberi
- No reinforcements or resupply
- "Battling Bastards of Bataan" - "No mama, no papa, no Uncle Sam"

**Why your lolo was likely here**: The 45th and 57th Infantry (Philippine Scouts) are clearly marked on this map. This line held until early April.

### **Phase 5: Final Japanese Breakthrough (April 7-9, 1942)**
**File**: `Bataan_Japanese_Advance.jpg`

**What it shows**:
- Red diagonal hatching = Japanese-held territory (April 7-9)
- Blue hatched = U.S. positions night of April 6-7
- Red arrows showing Japanese breakthrough and envelopment
- Dates: April 7 (main assault), April 8-9 (collapse)
- Defenders compressed to southern tip near Mariveles

**Tactical significance**:
- **The end** - massive Japanese artillery barrage April 3
- April 7: Japanese breakthrough with fresh troops
- April 8: Defensive lines disintegrating
- April 9, 1942: General Edward King surrenders 76,000 troops (largest US surrender in history)
- **Bataan Death March begins**

**What happened**:
- Soldiers too weak from starvation and disease to mount effective defense
- No ammunition reserves remaining
- Japanese used fresh 4th Division troops
- Corregidor held out until May 6, 1942
